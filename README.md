## ‚ú® What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents a significant shift from traditional AI models. Instead of just responding to a single prompt, an **AI Agent** can perform a series of actions to achieve a high-level goal. Think of it as the difference between a calculator and a human assistant.

An agent typically has four key properties:
1.  **Goal-Oriented:** It has a clear objective to achieve (e.g., "write a market analysis report").
2.  **Perception:** It can perceive its environment by using tools (e.g., searching the web, reading files).
3.  **Action:** It can take actions in its environment (e.g., writing code, sending emails, calling other APIs).
4.  **Autonomy:** It can operate and make decisions on its own to progress towards its goal.

This repository is my personal lab for building and experimenting with these powerful systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run any of the agents in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ujjwal012003/Agentic-Ai.git](https://github.com/Ujjwal012003/Agentic-Ai.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to an agent's directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Agentic-Ai/agent-directory-name
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the agent's directory.
    * Add your API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'`, `GEMINI_API_KEY='....'`, or any LLM).
